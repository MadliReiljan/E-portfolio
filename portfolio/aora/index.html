                Born and raised in Tartu, I have been a creative soul from a young age. My passion for art led me to explore digital art and programming in high school,
                sparking my journey into creating diverse projects, from digital to web design. <br><br>I am currently studying in Tartu Vocational Centre to become a junior developer.
                I am driven by a relentless curiosity, constantly seeking opportunities to learn and expand my knowledge through courses, workshops, and independent research. Being adaptable and quick to grasp complex ideas, I thrive on intellectual challenges and actively pursue skill development to stay current in my field.
                <br><br> 
                In team settings, I'm friendly and approachable, encouraging open conversations and teamwork. I think the best ideas come when we all chip in together.
