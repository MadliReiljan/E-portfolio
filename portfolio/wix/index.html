                I created my first project for a real client using the web content management system Wix. This platform allowed me to build a professional and user-friendly website that met the client's needs and expectations. <br><br> 
                Currently, the client manages the website independently, so if the design has changed since then, those modifications were made by the client themselves. <br><br>
                You can view the website from <a class="link" href="https://www.ketlynvillem.com/" target="_blank">HERE</a> <br><br>

              <p class="description2">
                This project taught me a lot in terms of both technical skills and communication. I learned to use the Wix application more thoroughly, including creating user-friendly navigation and setting up SEO to ensure that the website appeared high in Google search results. 
                I also gained valuable experience in communicating with the client and understanding their needs more precisely. 
                <br><br> 
                Initially, there was already an existing version of the website that the client had created with a friend. 
                However, since that friend was unable to complete the project, I took over and had to organize the entire website.

              <p class="description2">
              Using Wix for this project was ultimately a rewarding but also somewhat challenging experience. While the platform was beginner-friendly and offered many convenient features, the precise placement of elements was more difficult compared to using WordPress, where there is more freedom in design. However, it was a great learning opportunity on how to work with limitations and find creative solutions. 
              <br><br> 
              The greatest joy came from knowing that I was able to help someone who needed a website for their business. 
              The client was very satisfied with the final result, and we had a good working relationship, which made the entire process enjoyable.
