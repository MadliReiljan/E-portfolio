                The goal of this project was to create a website for a client offering massage, sugaring, and various other beauty services. The website was built on the WordPress platform to provide the client with a flexible and user-friendly solution for showcasing their services.<br><br>
  	            The current website is temporarily down due to hosting server issues, which is why it is not accessible online. However, I can show the final result of the project via Figma, where complete screenshots of some of the pages have been captured. Before the hosting server went down, I noticed that some text had unwanted extra content due to the WordPress platform, which was not intended to be there.

              <p class="description2">
                The most valuable lessons from this project came from communication with the client and learning the WordPress platform. The project took a longer period of time, but the tight schedule remained a limiting factor as it was difficult to get all the necessary materials from the client. This taught me patience and the ability to communicate more effectively to understand the client's needs, as well as time management and setting priorities.<br><br>
                Using WordPress was also a significant learning experience. Although I eventually managed to work well with the platform and found it flexible enough, the beginning was quite challenging. The WordPress system and, for example, the location of the navigation bar differed from many other platforms, which required some time to get used to. Elementor proved to be an easy tool for designing, but several essential features were locked behind a paid version, so I had to find creative solutions to achieve the desired results without incurring additional costs.
