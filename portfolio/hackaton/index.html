              <p class="description2">
                The created project is an educational and fun game designed specifically for students learning chemistry. The aim of the game was to help students acquire chemistry knowledge and develop their skills through an interactive and engaging learning experience. 
                <br><br> 
                Our team consisted of six people, none of whom had previous experience in game development. We had only two days to complete the game from start to finish.

              <p class="description2">
                The hackathon was an intense but highly rewarding experience that taught me several valuable skills: <br><br>
                &#x2022; <span style="font-weight: 700;">Teamwork and Role Assignment:</span> 
                Since we worked in a large team, we quickly had to establish clear roles and responsibilities so that everyone knew their tasks and could focus on specific objectives.<br><br>
                &#x2022; <span style="font-weight: 700;">Rapid Development Process (Sprinting):</span> 
                The two-day time frame taught me to work at an intense pace, focusing on quick ideation and prototyping.<br><br>
                &#x2022; <span style="font-weight: 700;">Animations and User Interface Experience:</span> 
                I worked more on animation and design. Within this short time, I was able to create small animations for the characters to make them feel more alive. This gave me experience in creating animations and integrating them into a rapid development process.<br><br>
                &#x2022; <span style="font-weight: 700;">Pixel Art and AI Generation:</span> 
                We decided that the game’s design would be in pixel art. We drew the main character ourselves, while the rest of the characters/backgrounds were generated using AI.

              <p class="description2">
                The experience was exhausting but also extremely rewarding, especially when we saw the finished game. Although my role was less focused on coding, I was very glad to be able to express my creative side – creating animations and designing the game’s characters. After a long development session, it was amazing to see how my contribution helped bring the game to life visually.
