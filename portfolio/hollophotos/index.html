                The website was created for a client who specializes in photographing cars. The goal of the project was to showcase car photos, making it easier for the photographer to present their work. Although the site is ready, they have not yet accepted it.

                Marion Poljakov assisted in the project.

                During this project, I had to create a portfolio, which turned out to be easy since I already have a portfolio of my own. The only challenging part was dealing with the images because the original sizes of the photos were very large, and the website couldn't load them. Therefore, I had to resize all the images individually to ensure the quality was maintained.
                <br><br> 
                I used GIMP to adjust the quality of the images and then export them to the correct size. I was also helped at times by an online website that allowed me to change the image sizes as well. I’m sure there are easier ways to do this, but at that moment, it seemed like the best option to me. This process taught me how important image optimization is for a website. Once again, communication with the client was essential to understand what the client wanted from the website and how to address the concerns.
